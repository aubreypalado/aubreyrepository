    The world I saw was very dark, but in the dark still saw the stars. I was trying to heal my broken heart. Trying to feel something that sparks
    I have regrets can not forget this is the last time I'm gonna let anyone play with my heart like a game. Now I think everyone else is the same.
    And then I met you unexpectedly you know how to make these demons really calm inside of me. I have been waiting for you for so long and then I knew
    that you where I belong. Making me feels right when it's all wrong this love I feel is strong. I dont know why but I feel I can fly time goes by
    I know this love will never die. Everytime I hide you go inside, in my dark cave then you put the light. I see the light shining so bright.
    Feel so alive, when you arrived and everybody knows that I cant control my feelings. Coz everytime I look into your eyes I see the paradise you bring
    me back to life, I just want you to know that your love just feels so right. Everytime I seee you smiling, I feel like the world is slowly spinning
    and all, and all I see is you.

    All I see is you in the dark, all I see, all I see is you.

    I know this love will never die. Everytime I hide you go inside, in my dark cave then you put the light. I see the light shining so bright.
    Feel so alive, when you arrived and everybody knows that I cant control my feelings. Coz everytime I look into your eyes I see the paradise you bring
    me back to life, I just want you to know that your love just feels so right. Everytime I seee you smiling, I feel like the world is slowly spinning
    and all, and all I see is you.

    All I see is you in the dark, all I see, all I see is you.



    The world I saw was very dark, but in the dark still saw the stars. I was trying to heal my broken heart. Trying to feel something that sparks
    I have regrets can not forget this is the last time I'm gonna let anyone play with my heart like a game. Now I think everyone else is the same.
    And then I met you unexpectedly you know how to make these demons really calm inside of me. I have been waiting for you for so long and then I knew
    that you where I belong. Making me feels right when it's all wrong this love I feel is strong. I dont know why but I feel I can fly time goes by
    I know this love will never die. Everytime I hide you go inside, in my dark cave then you put the light. I see the light shining so bright.
